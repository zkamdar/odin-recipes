    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Pasta sheets (such as lasagna noodles)</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>Meat (such as ground beef, sausage, or chicken)</li>
        <li>Vegetables (such as onions, garlic, mushrooms, bell peppers, and spinach)</li>
        <li>Cheese (such as mozzarella, Parmesan, and ricotta)</li>
        <li>Herbs and spices (such as oregano, basil, and thyme)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Milk or cream (for the cheese sauce)</li>
        <li>Flour (for the cheese sauce)</li>
        <li>Butter (for the cheese sauce)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius).</li>
        <li>Cook the pasta sheets according to the package instructions, then drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large saucepan, heat some olive oil over medium heat, then add the onions and garlic and saut√© until softened.</li>
        <li>Add the ground meat (if using) and cook until it is browned, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as it cooks.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes, along with the herbs and spices. Bring the sauce to a simmer and let it cook for about 10 minutes, or until it thickens slightly.</li>
        <li>In a separate saucepan, make the cheese sauce by melting the butter over medium heat, then whisking in the flour to form a roux. Slowly whisk in the milk or cream and continue to cook, whisking constantly, until the sauce thickens. Stir in the cheese and season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange a layer of pasta sheets over the sauce, then top with another layer of meat sauce. Repeat the layers, ending with a layer of pasta on top.</li>
        <li>Pour the cheese sauce over the top layer of pasta, then smooth it out with a spatula. Sprinkle a little extra cheese on top, if desired.</li>
        <li>Place the lasagna in the oven and bake for about 30 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly and the edges of the lasagna are golden brown.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy!</li>
