    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cheddar biscuits are a type of savory biscuit that is made with cheddar cheese. They are similar to traditional biscuits, but the addition of the cheddar cheese gives them a unique flavor and texture. Cheddar biscuits are often served as a side dish, but they can also be enjoyed on their own as a snack or appetizer. They are typically made with flour, butter, milk, cheddar cheese, and baking powder, and are often flavored with herbs and spices such as garlic or chives. The dough is rolled out and cut into shapes, then baked until golden brown and crispy on the outside, with a soft and cheesy interior.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour: This forms the base of the biscuit dough. Use all-purpose flour for the best results.</li>
        <li>Butter: This adds richness and flavor to the biscuits. Use unsalted butter so you can control the amount of salt in the recipe.
        </li>
        <li>Milk: This helps to bind the ingredients together and give the biscuits a tender texture. Use whole milk or 2% milk for the best results.</li>
        <li>Cheddar cheese: This is the main flavor component of the biscuits. Use a high-quality, sharp cheddar cheese that has a strong, tangy flavor.
        </li>
        <li>Baking powder: This helps the biscuits to rise and become light and fluffy. Make sure your baking powder is fresh for the best results.</li>
        <li>Salt: This helps to balance the flavors and enhance the overall taste of the biscuits. Use a fine sea salt or table salt.</li>
        <li>In addition to these basic ingredients, you can also add other ingredients to give your biscuits extra flavor. Some common additions include herbs and spices (such as garlic or chives), black pepper, or a little bit of sugar. Experiment with different combinations to find your favorite!</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="steps">Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>Cut the butter into small cubes and add it to the bowl. Using your fingers, rub the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles fine crumbs.</li>
        <li>Stir in the grated cheddar cheese until well combined.</li>
        <li>Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and pour in the milk. Using a fork, stir the ingredients together until a soft dough forms.</li>
        <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it gently a few times until it comes together.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough out to about 1/2-inch thickness and use a biscuit cutter or a glass to cut out rounds of dough. Place the biscuits on the prepared baking sheet, leaving a little space between them.</li>
        <li>Bake the biscuits for 10-12 minutes, or until they are golden brown and crispy on the outside, with a soft and cheesy interior.</li>
        <li>Remove the biscuits from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
